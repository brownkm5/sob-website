    <h5 class='center'>About Soby's</h5>
    <p>Soby's isn't a cookie cutter, "seen one seen `em all" kind of a restaurant. It's a special one-of-a-kind place, with a special history and traditions and emotions and pride.</p>
    <p>Soby's New South Cuisine is a blend of contemporary cuisine infused with traditional southern ingredients. The restaurant opened in 1997 and is housed in the warm environment of a renovated, century-old building and has a mezzanine level that can accommodate large parties ordering a la carte.</p>
    <p>Starting with fresh, seasonal ingredients, our chefs transform Southern favorites into something comfortable and fresh. The wine list is a consistent winner of Wine Spectator and Wine Enthusiast awards. Signature dishes include Barbecue Shrimp and Grits, Fried Green Tomatoes with Jalapeno Pimento Cheese, and Crab Cakes Remoulade. The experience includes complimentary valet parking and a smoke-free environment.</p>
    <p>Indulge yourself this evening, or any evening, Monday through Sunday. At Soby's New South Cuisine. In downtown Greenville. (864) 232-7007 Have mercy!</p>

  <div class="history">
    <h5 class='center'>History</h5>
    <p>Erected in the late 1800's, the building that now houses Soby's New South Cuisine was once a cotton exchange, a grocery store, bicycle shop and, most recently, a shoe store. The building's second life began in 1997 when partners Carl Sobocinski and David Williams completely refurbished it to its original beauty. Exposing the brick and hardwood floors revealed the charm of the old southern building and caught the attention of the Greater Greenville Association of Realtors, Inc. that recognized the restaurant as the Best Commercial Revitalization Project in 1998.</p>
    <p>Today Soby's restaurant is the place to be. Whether you want a quiet little booth for two, an outdoor table along Greenville's bustling Main Street or a larger, private party on the Mezzanine overlooking the kitchen, Soby's atomosphere is always oh so perfect!</p>

<h5>Wine at Soby's</h5>
<p>The award-winning wine list at Soby’s began with Carl Sobocinski’s love of domestic wines and continues to grow because of his curiosity of international regions. It contains fifty different grape varietals from hundreds of wine growing regions from around the world.  This list was first recognized for its excellence by Wine Spectator in 1998 and received the Best of Award of Excellence in 2003.</p>
<p>While 1,100 different wines may sound overwhelming, the Wine Director Eva Frye and the service team are dedicated to guiding you to the perfect bottle.  From a classic Bordeaux or Napa Valley Cabernet to aromatic beauties from Austria or legendary Pinot Noir from Burgundy your next delicious bottle is only a conversation away.</p>
